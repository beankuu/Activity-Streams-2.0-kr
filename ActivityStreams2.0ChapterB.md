## B. Deprecated Activity Streams 1.0 Syntax

_This section is non-normative._

Note: While this appendix sections is non-normative, it uses normative terms such as *MUST*. Where used, the meaning is to indicate what would be required to properly implement the Activity Streams 1.0 backwards compatibility model described in this appendix if an implementer chose to do so.

While the syntax defined by this specification diverges from that defined by JSON Activity Streams 1.0, the fundamental model defined by that original specification remains intact. Specific processing rules are defined by this specification that allow existing Activity Streams 1.0 documents to be mapped to and processed as an Activity Streams 2.0 document.

The JSON syntax defined by this specification differs somewhat from that defined in the original JSON Activity Streams 1.0 [ [AS1](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#bib-AS1)] specification in ways that are not backwards compatible. Implementations can choose to continue supporting the JSON Activity Streams 1.0 syntax but ought consider it to be deprecated. This means that while implementations can continue to consume the 1.0 syntax, they should not output the 1.0 syntax unless specifically interacting with older non-2.0 compliant implementations.

Specifically:

1. Implementations can use the "`application/stream+json`" MIME media type when producing a JSON serialization using the Activity Streams 1.0 syntax, and "`application/activity+json`" when producing a serialization conforming to the 2.0 syntax.
2. Implementations that process serializations identified using either the "`application/stream+json`" or the more generic "`application/json`" MIME media type *MUST* follow the syntax and processing rules set by [[AS1](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#bib-AS1)]. The 2.0 syntax and processing rules apply only when handling serializations using the "`application/activity+json`" media type.
3. When processing Activity Streams 1.0 documents using a JSON-LD processing model, implementations can use the special AS 1.0 to AS 2.0 expansion @context definition provided [here](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams1-context.jsonld) to produce the JSON-LD expanded representation. Refer to the [JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/#expansion-algorithms) for details.
4. When processing Activity Streams 1.0 documents and converting those to 2.0, implementations ought to treat `id` as an alias for the JSON-LD `@id` key word; and the `objectType` and `verb` properties as aliases for the JSON-LD `@type` keyword.
5. Activity Streams 1.0 uses the `displayName` property which has been renamed to `name` in Activity Streams 2.0. Implementations ought to treat `displayName` as an alias for `name`.
6. Activity Streams 1.0 uses the `title` property which has been dropped from Activity Streams 2.0. Implementations processing Activity Streams 1.0 documents as Activity Streams 2.0 ought to treat instances of the `title` property as an extension.
7. This document redefines the [content](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-content) and [summary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-summary) properties as natural language values which means their values can be expressed as either a string or an object mapping language tags to string values. In the 1.0 syntax, these are expressed solely as String values. Because the 1.0 values are a valid subset allowed by this specification, implementations are not required to take any specific action to continue supporting those values.
8. This document redefines a large number of common properties defined originally as Objects in 1.0 as either [Objects](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#asobject) or [Links](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#dfn-link). The JSON-LD serialization allows such property values to be expressed as either an IRI String, an JSON object, or an Array of IRI Strings and JSON objects. Because the 1.0 values are a valid subset allowed by this specification, existing implementations are not required to take any specific action to continue supporting those values.
9. This specification deprecates the `upstreamDuplicates` and `downstreamDuplicates` properties defined by Activity Streams 1.0 and does not provide a replacement. This is due largely to lack of any reasonable implementation evidence. While the `upstreamDuplicates` and `downstreamDuplicates` properties MAY continue to be used, implementations *SHOULD* avoid them.
10. In Activity Streams 1.0, the "`post`" verb was defined to describe the action of both creating an object and "posting" or uploading it to a service. This specification replaces the "`post`" verb with separate [Create](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create) and [Add](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-add) Activity types. When processing Activity Streams 1.0 documents and converting those into 2.0, implementations *SHOULD* treat instances of the " `post`" verb as equivalent to [Create](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create) if there is _no `target` property specified_; and equivalent to [Add](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-add) if there is a *target* property specified.

By following these guidelines, all JSON Activity Streams 1.0 serializations can be processed successfully by 2.0 implementations.
